Employers including farms, nurseries and wineries, routinely employ people who are in the United States illegally but who can produce a Social Security card or work visa. Many agricultural employers say it's not their responsibility and that they lack the expertise to determine if the documents are genuine. What is President Trump doing to prevent foreign nationals from voting in US elections?

Thomas Smith After quomo is jailed for messing with children it won matter..
Tony Levan I believe if a candidate drops out or loses an election that any campaign money they have should be turned in to the federal, state, or local tax departments depending upon what office they are campaigning for. NO monies should be shared within a party.
