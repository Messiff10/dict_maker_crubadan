Employers including farms, nurseries and wineries, routinely employ people who are in the United States illegally but who can produce a Social Security card or work visa. Many agricultural employers say it's not their responsibility and that they lack the expertise to determine if the documents are genuine. What is President Trump doing to prevent foreign nationals from voting in US elections?

Thomas Smith After quomo is jailed for messing with children it won matter..	
Tony Levan I believe if a candidate drops out or loses an election that any campaign money they have should be turned in to the federal, state, or local tax departments depending upon what office they are campaigning for. NO monies should be shared within a party.

didn't want to waste all of his break dancing . But one guy seemed not to want to let go of him . Leo nearly stood up before Ten wrapped his tail around the guy's hand and yanked it off him . The other students held on their freind as Ten left , telling him how that wasn't cool . Ten sat next to Leo , sighing and only brightening up when he saw Ravi left him his favorite cocktail , same with yours on the table . " Ten points off Slytherin . " He said jokingly , but because he saw Leo was ready to rant , he spoke first . " Its okay . Its not the first or last time , and I always sneak out of it . " He said with a shrug . Looking at you , he smiled . " How do you like it ? " He asked , talking about the cocktail . 
Why are you sounding like that

We've seen dogs and cats trained to do some pretty amazing stuff, but impressive is certainly a first. A video uploaded in 2013 is making rounds on the Internet again, and within a few seconds of watching it, you'll see why. A man from Wales on his lunch hour took some time to feed the seagulls. During his break, he somehow found a way to train the bird to in exchange for chips. He says, "Dance!" and the bird then does a brief (but super-adorable) tap routine. After his Fred Astaire-like moves, the man throws the grooving birdie a snack. According to the , the seagull is used to dancing for food. While chips probably aren't as satisfying as wormsto themwe're glad the birdie still did the routine for the Welshman. More than anything though, we're happy that it was all captured on camera so we can watch it over and over again. [ ] 
What would you do if you found out your man was cheating? Call his parents? Go to Facebook to post a heated status? Run around the neighborhood alerting everyone in sight? One Texas woman sought revenge in the most clever wayshe went straight for the classified section of her local newspaper.

That's rightnot only did he cheat, but he was having a with the other woman. While it's not clear when the ad was published, the newspaper ad was shared on Facebook and Reddit. Yet another good reason why you should never cheat on a spouse.

With fantasy colors like and vivid teal becoming hugely popular in the last few years, has officially gone mainstream. You've probably even seen fun shades on a few fashionable dogs. However, even though Fido looks pretty in pink, dyeing a dog's hair with a product intended only for humans can cause a pup serious injury. One animal shelter in Florida is sharing a cautionary tale in hopes of making that perfectly clear. On January 23, posted 16 photos along with the story of Violet, a who came to them in terrible condition due to the hair dye someone had used to color her naturally white fur. "Violet's eyes were swollen shut, she was limp and listless, she had obvious burns to her skin," the post reads regarding what the dye had done to her. "We gave fluids, pain meds and we gently washed as much of the chemical dye off as we could." After bandaging her up, the shelter's vet took her home for the night to keep an eye on her. The next day, they decided to shave her to more thoroughly assess her injuries. "To our horror her skin began to slough off," the post reads. "Good thing Violet was peacefully anesthetized. It was so much worse than we initially thought." PCAS wasn't sure if little Violet, named for the shade of purple she showed up in, would suffer permanent blindness or even survive the horrible skin wounds caused by the dye. But this pooch was determined to thrive. "Fast forward 3 months pain medication, antibiotics, IV fluids, honey treatments, scab removal, anesthetizing, bandage changes, sleepless nights, worrying, hope, worrying, hope and finally the silver lining," PCAS writes. "She began to walk the halls, visiting each office requesting treats or hugs or gentle pats, always in the lead with our veterinarian in tow. It was clear Violet was on the mend and she wanted everyone to know it." Just like humans can experience allergic reactions or chemical burns from hair dye, so can dogs, explains , Good Housekeeping Institute's Senior Chemist. "Humans also color a relatively small portion of hair, and in the case of this poor dog, the color is applied over its entire body, hence the likelihood of the dog getting sensitized being much greater." The reaction, Wizemann says, is likely due to overexposure to a chemical commonly found in hair dye, PPD (paraphenylenediamine). Luckily, Violet's loving new owners are professional groomers who would never use hair dye for humans on her. And considering what she's been through, they probably won't use dye intended for dogs, either. Wigs, however, are another story. 
While Disney movies would sometimes have you believe otherwise, wild animals will not magically become tame if you believe hard enough. This truth is painfully clear in a disturbing video of a girl being dragged into the water by a sea lion. The video, shot at British Columbia's Steveston Fisherman's Wharf, was shot by college student Michael Fujiwara. , Fujiwara shared that a family had been feeding the sea lion bread crumbs as the girl sat on the wharf side. "It initially jumped up to the girl to read her I guess," Fujiwara shared, "And then it came back up a second time, but this time grabbing the girl by the waist and dragging her down into the water." He also shares that while he doesn't know if the man who dives into the water to save the girl was a relative, the girl and her family immediately left the scene. An animal expert interviewed by the CBC claims that it's likely that the sea lion was both used to being fed by humans, and also might've mistaken the girl's dress for fish. This video is a reminder that wild animals' actual instincts don't often line up with human caricatures of certain species. And the next time you feel the urge to throw food into a crowd of feral critters, maybe double check where you're standing or sitting.

," take a minute to check it out. It's in response to the announcement that Obama has made a decision that holds an uncomfortably close resemblance to one that Bush might have made: an order to send approximately 30,000 more troops to Afghanistanpart of an elaborate plan, one with a reported "clear exit-strategy," that he intends to explain in detail tonight in a National Address from the U.S. Military Academy. I did appreciate Mr. Moore's letter. However dramatically one-sided the documentarian is, his POV always at least partially alludes to the way half of this country feels. And that half of the country wanted to believe that Obama would only withdraw troopsespecially after a political campaign that screamed change from our current at-war status. (Note: Obama's promises to withdraw troops, however, were very specifically focused on Iraq. In , he does make mention of his plans to refocus attention on Afghanistan, where he believes there still exists a growing terrorist threat.) So the country's left to wonder, when is this going to end? And especially following this recent announcement and in anticipation of tonight's address, their wonder is swelling. That said, and to blithely mix sports and political analogies, I'm throwing up the flag on Mr. Moore: Unnecessary roughness, defense, repeat first draft. It's unthinkable to me that Moore truly believes his opinions/would-be decisions are based on the same information that Obama's are. Give the man a chance to explain. I at least plan to do that before I've officially nicknamed Obama "The War President," as Moore already has. If you'd like to do the same, tune into Obama's speech tonight. 
Although Peter and Joan Petrasek died 13 years apart, the Seattle-based couple had an identical benefactor to whom they dedicated everything they had in life: America. Joan passed away from breast cancer in 1998, and Peter succumbed to a heart attack in 2012, but it took years for their unorthodox request to be processed. On May 13, 2015, a cashier's check for $847,215.57 was deposited into the U.S. Department of the Treasury's general funds, . According to the , Peter Petrasek was born Vlastimil Petrasek in Prague, Czechoslovakia, and was only 12 years old when the Nazis invaded the city. His father was hauled off to a camp and his sister ended up in a factory in Dresden, where she died during a firestorm bombing. Petrasek ended up at a youth camp, where he learned how to fly a plane, and managed to hike into Switzerland after being shot down. He then escaped to Ottawa, Canada, where he met Joan and married her in July 1951. They moved to Seattle, where Peter worked as a metallurgist and Joan worked as an upholsterer. Neighbors described them as a frugal pair, even going so far as to recycle the oil for their furnace. While the reserved pair never explicitly expressed why they decided to leave such a generous gift, it seems likely that the donation was a mark of gratitude to the country that gave them such a happy life after so much struggle. "This case is interesting because it seems to be that these were two immigrants who felt grateful to have this adoptive country open its arms to them after having a hard time in eastern Europe during World War II," U.S. assistant attorney Peter Winn, who handled the case, said. "It really reminds you how this country was founded by immigrants, and it's pretty obvious these folks felt pretty proud they were U.S. citizens." 
Use pointed tweezers to grasp the tick by its head or mouthparts right where they enter the skin. (View them through a magnifying glass if necessary.) Swiftly and firmly pull the tick out (don't twist). Clean the area with rubbing alcohol. Place the tick in a jar or sealed bag with rubbing alcohol. Call your doctor and ask if you should save it (some doctors may want to examine it to figure out how long it's been on your skin, says Dr. Fish). If you develop a rash near the bite (it could take up to 30 days), see your doctor. You may have Lyme disease and need an antibiotic (doxycycline). 
While his sidekick star Charlie Brown made his first appearance in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade back in 2002. His balloon depicted him trying to kick a football in his trademark yellow-striped shirt and black short. The image is, of course, based on the famous clip of Charlie trying to kick the ball, only to have Lucy pull it away at the last moment. The balloon made appearances every year until 2005, then took a hiatus until 2012. But despite that seven-year gap, the Charlie Brown balloon's design remained the same. That changes this year, though. Marking Macy's 90th Thanksgiving Day parade and the 50th anniversary of the musical , the character is getting a new lookhis second ever in the parade's history. Instead of a football, Charlie will be flying a red kite and will be tangled up in the string. The scene comes from the musical, where he's trying to fly a kite, only to get it caught in a tree. According to Mashable, the new balloon will be 53-feet-long, 46-feet-tall and 31-feet-wide. Can't wait to see the new Charlie balloon? Neither can we! Get a sneak peek of it below, and head to for a complete behind-the-scenes look. Thanksgiving cannot come soon enough! 
Teens, and sometimes preteens, are being diagnosed with type 2 diabetesthe more common form in which your body doesn't respond to insulin or doesn't produce enoughand there's a huge upsurge in type 2 cases among people in their 20s and 30s. Basically, every member of the family needs to be concerned about the risk. In fact, according to the latest numbers, a whopping 8% of the population has , an increase of 1.6 million since 2006. And experts estimate that 1 out of every 3 children born today will develop the condition. "We are in dire need of stopping this increase because nearly every piece of your body is damaged by diabetesthe blood vessels, the heart, the skin, the nervous system, the GI tract, the kidneys, the eyes and the brain," says Francine R. Kaufman, MD, head of the Center for Diabetes at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles, and chair of the National Diabetes Education Program. Indeed, research shows that poorly controlled diabetes raises the risk of many serious conditions including heart disease, stroke, depression and even some cancers. It's also the leading cause of kidney failure and adult blindness, notes Ann Albright, PhD, RD, director of the division of diabetes translation at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and president of and education at the American Diabetes Association (ADA). But you avoid this looming health risk. Experts say that simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference in whether you develop diabetes or not. Exercising and eating well, which helps you lose a small amount of weight, can lower your risk by 58%. " is almost totally preventable by a healthy lifestyle," says Robert A. Rizza, MD, past president of the ADA and a professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. "If you stay lean and fit, you reduce your chances of developing type 2 diabetes by 90%." Even if you've been diagnosed with diabetes, research shows that improving diet and exercise can help prevent complications, lower the dosage of drugs or even eliminate the need for them altogether. Know what the right-size portions look like Almost any restaurant or takeout dish is double or triple what you should be eating in one meal. And we do so much buying in bulk that every now and then we need a refresher on what one serving really looks like. A quick guide: One serving of meat, chicken or fish is the size of your palm; of rice and pasta, about the size of a baseball; of oils and butter, about the tip of your thumb. Load up on what you find in nature: fruits, vegetables, nuts, legumes, whole grains, lean protein and lowfat dairy products. One study showed that for every additional two servings of whole grains women ate a day, their risk of developing type 2 diabetes went down 21%. Other research has found that middle-age women who ate the most dairy also had a 21% lower risk of developing diabetes than those who ate the least. The sugar from juice and soda is so concentrated that it enters your bloodstream immediately and your body has to produce a quick burst of insulin to deal with it, explains Dr. Kaufman. If you prompt your body to do this frequently, it can lead to weight gain and increase your risk of becoming insulin-resistant (your body will start to need extra insulin, a hormone that maintains normal in the body). This in turn may lead to diabetes. Cap the amount of juice everyone in the family drinks at no more than 1 cup daily; better yet, dilute it with water or club soda. Besides helping you stay at a healthy weight, regular physical activitysuch as walking, jogging, biking, swimminghelps your body use insulin better. And you can break it up into two or three sessions: One study found that people who racked up 30 minutes of moderate activity five times a week have a much lower risk of the disease than those who don't exercise regularly. Get everyone moving by scheduling a nightly after-dinner family walk. "Inadequate sleep reduces your body's ability to produce and respond to insulin, which may contribute to the development of type 2 diabetes," Dr. Albright says. One study found that people who regularly slept five or fewer hours a night were almost twice as likely to develop diabetes than those who slept seven hours a night. Quality counts too, so if you think you're sleeping enough but are still tired, get screened for apnea, sleep-disordered breathing and restless leg syndrome. Each of these has been linked with impaired glucose tolerance, a pre-diabetic condition. Stress is unavoidable; it's how you deal with it that makes the difference. "Chronic stress can trigger inflammation in the body, which may lead to insulin resistance and raise diabetes risk," says David Nathan, MD, director of the Diabetes Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a professor of medicine at Harvard. If you make decompressing a daily habit, your body won't be as damaged by stress when it hits. Excess weight can lead to chemical changes that increase diabetes risk as well as cause inflammation, says Dr. Nathan. Ideally your BMI should fall in the normal range (under 25), but even losing 5 to 7% of your weightwhich translates to 10 to 15 pounds for someone who weighs 200 poundscan dramatically reduce your risk of developing diabetes, according to the Diabetes Prevention Program. When I was 16, my periods disappeared and didn't come back for more than a year. I also started feeling hungrier than usual and became much more muscular. My doctor wasn't concernedhe said these symptoms were probably cropping up because I worked out a lotbut my mom wasn't so sure. When she spotted some dark hair growing on my belly, she took me to another doctor. This doctor ordered a battery of blood tests, which showed that I had polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a hormonal and metabolic disorder that's often associated with resistance. He put me on birth control pills to regulate my periods and gave me another drug, called spironolactone, to counteract the excessive amount of male hormones that my body was producing. Everything seemed under control until two years ago. I started breaking out a lot and craving sweets all the time, which caused me to quickly gain about 20 pounds. I used to be really energetic and upbeat, and all of a sudden I was depressed, sluggish and really uncomfortable in my body. Finally, an endocrinologist who specializes in PCOS diagnosed me with pre-diabetes. She encouraged me to cut down on refined carbs (like white bread, pasta and sweets) and to get more exercise. She also prescribed a slew of drugs, including metformin, which she said would help get my under control. I now take eight pills a day, which is more than my grandmother takes! But it's worth it: I've lost weight, have more energy, and feel more like my old self again. In 1995 I found out that not only did I have type 2 , but my blood sugar was in the 300s! [Normal is less than 100.] The doctor who diagnosed me gave me a shot of insulin right there in the office. As a physician, I shouldn't have been shocked. I had gestational diabetes while I was pregnant with my second child 10 years before, and my weight had crept up to 205 pounds (I'm 5'5"). I was also starting to feel thirsty all the time and running to the bathroom. But I was too busy to worry about my health until I developed Bell's palsy (a temporary paralysis of half my face) and shingles. That's when I went to the doctor who diagnosed me with diabetes. She prescribed oral medications and told me to limit carbohydrates, fat and alcohol. Within four years my blood sugar had improved enough that I no longer needed the medication, but I was still struggling with my weight and my blood pressure was too high. The turning point came in 2003. I literally woke up one day and decided that I was done with dieting; I needed to make a permanent commitment to lead an overall healthier life. I joined a gym, hired a personal trainer, and started working out six days a week. I also revamped my eating habits: I started eating five small meals a daymostly complex carbs (like salads and veggies) and lean protein (such as egg whites, chicken, turkey or fish). Today I weigh in at a lean 130 pounds and my blood sugar is now in the 80s or 90s. I even started competing in bodybuilding contests! I had never worn a bikini before, and now I'm competing in one in front of thousands of people. Two years ago, when the texture of my hair changed and patches starting falling out, I mostly worried about how I was going to look. But my hairstylist, Synia Jordan, made me realize that my health could be in danger. I had been seeing Synia for nearly seven years, and we always talked about a lot more than my hair. I told her that I had been diagnosed with diabetes in 1990, but that it was "only" type 2 and I was taking medications that would keep me healthy. I wasn't on insulin, and my kidneys weren't showing any signs of problems, so I didn't think it was a big deal. But when I started filling out a survey from Synia's program, I got nervous. (She had recently joined the National Kidney Foundation's Healthy Hair Starts with a Healthy Body program, which trains stylists to talk to clients about their risks of diabetes, high blood pressure and kidney disease.) I was doing everything wrong, from not eating as many vegetables as I should to not exercising enough. I also weighed about 190 pounds, and I'm only 5'3". What really scared me the most was talking to Synia about her mom, who was on dialysis. Around the same time, a friend who was a learned that she needed a kidney transplant. That's when I realized that I wasn't OK, and that I needed to make some major changes to prevent these kinds of problems. In the past, I had promised my doctor I would diet and exercise, but it was always so hard and I gave up quickly. This time, I joined a diabetic education program and, with their support, finally stuck it out. Now I'm down to 147 pounds and my doctor has even lowered my dose of medication. Research has shown that people who regularly have the following foods may be less likely to develop type 2 : 1. Whole grains (including oatmeal, whole-grain breads and cereals) 2. Spinach, kale and other leafy greens 3. Lowfat dairy 4. Coffee The current guidelines call for anyone 45 and older to get screened for diabetes, but ask your doctor about doing it earlier if you have any risk factors, including a family history of the disease, a body mass index (BMI) over 25 (go to womansday.com/bmi to learn yours), high blood pressure, low HDL ("good") cholesterol, or if you had gestational diabetes or a baby weighing more than 9 pounds. Certain ethnic groups are also at a higher risk, including African-Americans, Native Americans, Latinos and Asians. Your doctor will give you one of these tests (or both): a fasting blood sugar test, in which your are measured after fasting for eight hours, or an oral glucose tolerance test, in which your blood sugar levels are tested after you drink a sweet liquid that contains glucose, a type of sugar. The oral glucose test is often used to diagnose gestational diabetes in pregnant women. The results of both tests can also tell your doctor if you have pre-diabetes (your levels are too high to be normal but not high enough to be diabetes). Excessive thirst or hunger or frequent urination are the well-knowns, but here are some not-as-apparent clues that you may be on the road to developing the disease and should talk to your health care provider ASAP: 1. Recurrent vaginal yeast infections 2. Tingling in the extremities 3. Blurred vision 4. Gum infections 5. Fatigue 6. Trouble concentrating 7. Poor wound healing 8. Unexplained weight loss Step one: Exercise more, eat healthier and slim down if you're overweight. "Being diagnosed with pre-diabetes is more than a warning," says Paul S. Jellinger, MD, past president of the American College of Endocrinology. "It's evidence that the disease process has already begun." In fact, studies suggest that most people with pre-diabetes (meaning your blood sugar is high but not high enough to be diabetes) will develop within 10 years. But you can lower your risk with these crucial steps: Aim to shed 5 to 10% of your body weight. In the landmark Diabetes Prevention Program study, people who did this lowered their risk of developing diabetes by 58%. at least 30 minutes five days a week or more. and a hemoglobin A1c test at least once a year. The A1c tests gives a sense of your sugar levels over the past three months. and triglycerides every 612 months. Levels should be kept as low as is recommended for diabetics, which may mean taking meds. (as low as is recommended for diabetics). if you're at especially high risk for developing diabetes.
